A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software.
 The term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may also lack connotations of engineering education or skills.

Margaret Hamilton promoted the term "software engineering" during her work on the Apollo program. 
The term "engineering" was used to acknowledge that the work should be taken just as seriously as other contributions toward the advancement of technology.
